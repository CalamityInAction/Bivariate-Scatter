# Bivariate-Scatter

###### I made two scatterplots because the first was too qualitative for what was useful for the assignment.
I first compared the number of kids to the income of a house. I chose these because I've had a curiosity regarding household characteristics and socioeconomic traits for a long time. The data showed a clear trend for 0 kids having the most income in a house, ranging up to about 4 million, and houses with 1-4 kids have a large range. There is a SHARP decline in income for families with 5 or more kids, which begs the question of which causations are at play here.

###### I enjoy those findings, but they resembled more of a dotted frequency chart than a scatterplot.
I next looked at the relationship between household income and debt, being more cut and dry but still a very important metric to account for with consumers. I chose it since it demystifies conversations on debt, although it is very straightforward. The graph has a negative correlation with debt and income, with income negatively correlating with debt. I'm curious for the few outliers with a lot of money and a comprable amount of debt.
